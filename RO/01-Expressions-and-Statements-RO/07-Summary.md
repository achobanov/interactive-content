# Summary

## In this lesson we learned: 

- What are Variables and how we use them

```java
String name = "Bob";
boolean employed = true;
int age = 35;
```

- Data Types definition

``` java
int a = 5;
String text = "Some text";
char letter = 'A';
float f = 4.2;
```

- Statements (commands)

- How to read User **Input** and Formatting **Output**

```java live
System.out.println("Hello World");
System.out.println(5);
System.out.println(3.14159265358979);
```

- How to work with simple arithmetical operations

```java live
int a = 25;
int i = a / 4;
System.out.println(i);
double f = a / 4.0;
System.out.println(f);
```

- How we use **Expressions** 

```java
int r = (150-20) / 2 + 5;
```

## In the next lesson we will learn:

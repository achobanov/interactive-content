## Description
Until the command "STOP" you will be receiving movie titles.

The best movie for you will be the one that has the most points.

Points are calculated by adding all of the ASCII character values in the movie title.

There will not be a case in which there are two films with an equal number of points.

Keep in mind the following:
- For each lowercase letter in the movie title, you must subtract twice the length of the movie title from the final sum.
- For each uppercase letter in the title, the length of the movie title should be subtracted from the final sum.
There can be a maximum of 7 movie titles.

## Input
You receive multiple lines from the console until the command "STOP" is recieved or until the limit of 7 movies is reached:
- Movie title â€“ string;

## Output
Print out on the console:

- If you have reached the limit of 7 movies you should print out: "The limit is reached."
- Print out the movie, holding the highest score: "The best movie for you is \{movie title\} with \{sum of symbols\} ASCII sum."

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matrix | The best movie for you is Breaking bad with 878 ASCII sum. | First we get Matrix, the first letter is M with a value of 77, but it is a capital letter and we subtract from it the length of the title: 77 - 6 = 71. |
| Breaking bad | | The second letter is a with a value of 97 and we subtract twice the movie title: 97 - 12 = 85.|
| Legend | | Similarly, we proceed with each subsequent letter and receive an amount of 563. |
| STOP | | Upon receiving the STOP command, we print the title with the highest value, which is Breaking bad with sum of 878. |

## Description
John works in a restaurant and is responsible for loading the dishwasher at the end of the day. 

Your task is to write a program that calculates **whether** a purchased quantity of bottles of dishwasher detergent is **enough** to wash a certain amount of vessels. 

It is known that each bottle contains **750 ml.** detergent. 

For 1 **plate** 5 ml is needed, and for a **pots** 15 ml. 

Accept that on every **third** filling with vessels, the dishwasher is filled only with pots, and the other times with plates. 

Until you get the command **"END"** you will continue to receive the number of vessels that need to be washed.

# Input
Read from the console: 
- **Number of bottles of detergent** that will be used for washing of plates - integer in range \[1...10\] 

On each **subsequent** line, until the command **"End"** or until **the amount of detergent is not run out**, the **number of vessels** that need to be washed - integer in range \[1...100\]

# Output
- In case that the amount of detergent **was sufficient** for the washing of the vessels, print three lines of output: 
    - "Detergent was enough!"
    - "\{Number of clean plates\} dishes and \{number of clean pots\} pots were washed."
    - "Leftover detergent \{amount of detergent remaining\} ml." 
- If the amount of detergent **was not sufficient** for the washing of the vessels, print the following line: 
    - "Not enough detergent, \{quantity not reached detergent\} ml. more necessary!"

## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Detergent was enough! |
| 53 | 118 dishes and 55 pots were washed. |
| 65 | Leftover detergent 85 ml. |
| 55 | |
| End | |

### Comments
- Detergent quantity = 2 \* 750 = 1500 ml.
- 53 plates are loaded = > 53 \* 5 = 265 ml.  1500 \- 265 = 1235 ml. (residue)
- 65 plates = > 65 \* 5 = 325 ml 1235 \- 325 = 910 ml. (residue)
- 55 pots = > 55 \* 15 = 825 ml 910\- 825 = 85 ml. (residue)
- We receive the command "End", therefore the quantity is reached and the corresponding message is printed: number of plates = 53 \+ 65 = 118. Number of pots = 55

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |

[task-description]
## Description
At a charity event, payments for the purchased products are always **alternated**: **cash payment and card payment**. **Always first payment method is cash**.

The following payment rules have been established:
- If the product **exceeds 100 dollars**, it **cannot be paid in cash**
- If the product is priced **under 10 dollars**, it **cannot be paid by credit card**

The program ends either after we receive the command **"End"**, or after the **funds are collected**.

## Input
Read from the console:
- The amount **expected to be collected** from sales - integer in range \[1...10000\] 

On each subsequent line, until the **"End"** command is received or until **the necessary funds are collected**: 
    - **The prices of items** to be purchased - integer in range \[1...500\]

## Output
Print on the console:
- In case of successful transaction: "Product sold!" 
- In case of unsuccessful transaction: "Error in transaction!" 
- If the sum of all purchased products **exceeds or reaches the expected amount**, the program must be completed and **two lines** are printed to the console: 
    - "Average CS: \{average payment in person's cash\}" 
    - "Average CC: \{average card payment per person\}"
    Payments must be **formatted to the second digit after the decimal point**.
- When the **"End"** command is received, **one line** is written:
    - "Failed to collect required money for charity."

## Example

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 500| Error in transaction!|
| 120| Error in transaction!|
| 8| Product sold!|
| 63| Product sold!|
| 256| Product sold!|
| 78| Product sold!|
| 317| Average CS: 70.50|
| | Average CC: 286.50|

### Comments
- The condition is rotated first in **cash payment**, then through **credit card**
- 120 > 100 transaction is rejected 
- 8 < 10 transaction is rejected 
- 63 <= 100 => the transaction was successful
- 256 >= 10 => the transaction was successful 
- 78 <= 100 => the transaction was successful 
- 317 >= 10 => the transaction was successful 
- Total amount collected: 63 + 256 + 78 + 317 = 714 
- 714 >= 500
- Total cash: 63 + 78 = 141;  Average cash: 141/2 = 70.50 
- Total credit cards: 256 \+ 317 = 573; Average credit cards: 573/2 = 286.50

## Description
You will receive symbols the "**End**" command. 

You skip the **non-letter chars** and the first occurence of **c**, **o**  and **n** (code chars).

When you **first receive** one of these letters, you have to mark it as visited, **but it is not saved in the word**.

After you have found **all three code chars from the command**, you have to print the word with a space and reset the counting of the code chars.

## Input
- Read a sequence of lines with a single symbol each, until you receive the "**End**" command

## Output
- Print on the console **every word after the secret command** followed by **space**

## Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| H | Hello |
| n| |
| e| |
| l| |
| l| |
| o| | 
| o| |
| c| |
| End| |

### Comments
- "**H**", "**n**", "**e**", "**l**", "**l**", "**o**", "**o**", "**c**" are all read letters.
- First we read "**H**" and we add it to the word. The next symbol is "**n**". It\'s part of the command and we **do not add it to the word as we meet it for the first time**.
- The next symbols are "**e**", "**l**", "**l**" and we add them to the word. We read "**o**" and we mark it as visited, but again we do **not** add it to the word. The next letter is "**o**" again and it\'s added. The next is "**c**" and all three symbols for the secret command are available.
- We print "**Hello** " and we recieve "End" command and the programs ends. The result is "Hello ".
